# Final Project - Game of Thrones Sentiment Analysis in R
This repository contains my final project for my Text & Unstructured Data Analytics course during the MS in Business Anlytics program at UNCW.
I performed a sentiment analysis in R on the entire raw script of the television adaptation of Game of Thrones. I applied TF-IDF, tokenization, and created visualizations to identify key thematic insights.
